# turf-ContourLines
a JS tool to draw contour lines from a TIN using turf.js

this tool takes a TIN ( Triangular Irregular Network) based on turf.tin
and generates contour lines for equal heights

I no longer work on this Repository, since there is already a plugin for turfJS that does this.
Check :  https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/tree/master/packages/turf-isolines

Good luck
